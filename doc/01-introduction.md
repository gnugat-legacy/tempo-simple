# Introduction

If you have:

* a daily report to send at the end of the day
* a weekly report to send every monday morning
* a report of the number of working days spent on each tasks at the end of the month
* an activity report to print at the end of the month

Then TempoSimple can help you: when you finish a task, punch a new time card
which will state:

* the day
* the project
* the task
* the start hour
* the end hour
* a description

You think those 6 information are too much to ask? Don't panic! TempoSimple will
guess almost everything.

Take a look at the [usage documentation](03-usage.md) in order to have a grasp
of TempoSimple's power.
